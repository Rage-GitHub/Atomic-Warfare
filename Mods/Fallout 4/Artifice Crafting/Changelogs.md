  - This does not make the patch required, but this is a base for the patch and others to categorize items.
- REVISED Ammo Crafting Recipes
  - This swaps out the components required for the new **Ammo Scrap** junk item which can be acquired from scrapping random items or found in the world.
- FIXED Missing Keywords for Patches
