# Welcome to Atomic Warfare
Atomic Warfare is a comprehensive modlist that focuses on improving over the Vanilla Fallout 4 with better mechanics, additional content to explore, and an overall immersive experience.

## | Main Takeaways
Atomic Warfare provides an overall balanced and fair content to performance ratio, allowing for a wide variety of visuals to appear while also not sacrificing your FPS to the FPS Gods. With this, a lot of really great and popular Quest mods, such Fourville, Old Time Religion, Point Lookout and more have been featured within this Collection.

### Quests and Adventures
- Fourville
- Miami Misadventures: Episode 1
- Nuka World Plus
- Old Time Religion
- Fallout 4: Point Lookout
- Tales from the Commonwealth (And it's Addons)

### Noticeable Features
- Vastly improved gunplay, allowing diverse ways to take out your enemy such as new leaning mechanics, real bullet projectiles, cleaner, more realistic headsets and overall a harsher way to survive.
- Survival needs without the need of the Survival gamemode and it's restrictions, allowing you to truly control how you want your survival playthrough to be.
- Lots of amazing Capital Wasteland and New Vegas content, offering a lore-friendly(ish) way of introducing content from the two other amazing wasteland adventures
- Luscious and overhauled visuals for the maximum fidelity without compromise to give you the freedom of exploring the game like it was vanilla without the loss of vanilla.
- Specifically chosen game tweaks to provide the best and most optimized experience for Fallout 4 there is, with hundreds of mods running simultaneously.

I've been tweaking and making necessary changes to optimize Fallout 4 to the best of it's capability, while retaining fidelity to offer the best visual to performance ratio. An example of Downtown Boston, near Goodneighbor, which is usually the most taxing location can be seen in the media.

## | Other Things to Note
I'm looking for comparisons on other systems to see how well the game runs, so I can manage and fine-tweak more settings to help the majority of users. Share your Specs, average framerates and locations of specific areas hurting your FPS in the discussions tab.

## | Requirements
- Clean Fallout 4 Install﻿
- FO4Edit

### Best practices
- Avoid from editing the modlist too much, everything is changed for a reason. If you choose to edit it, support is not provided and you will be ignored.

# Prerequisites Before Beginning
Modlists from Wabbajack generally require a clean installation of Fallout 4 and no mods installed whatsoever. For this reason, before you install anything, perform a clean installation of Fallout 4. To do so, follow these steps:

Locate your games directory, right-click the game folder and hit delete
Navigate to Documents > MyGames and delete the Fallout4 folder
Go back to your launcher, then reinstall Fallout 4.
Once it's installed, boot the game up and let the launcher load default values

It is highly recommended, if at all, required for you to install Fallout 4 outside of your C: drive and somewhere on another drive like an SSD or M.2. This will substantially help in load times, file redundancy and generally good practices.

## | Installing the Modlist via Wabbajack
Now that you've performed a clean install for Fallout 4 and generated all of the necessary files, it's time to install the modlist itself. 

To begin, go to the a new drive location, I.E. the base directory for a drive, create a new folder and call it whatever you please, Wabbajack ideally. Inside of that folder, download the Wabbajack tool itself and run it inside of that folder. Create a new folder inside of the Wabbajack directory and call it Modlists.

The folder structure should look as follows:

```
﻿Wabbajack (Make This)
┗ Downloads (Make This)
┗ Modlists (Make This)
  ┗ Atomic Warfare (Automatically Made by Wabbajack) 
    ┗ (Wabbajack Files Will Download Here)
```

Now, launch Wabbajack and download the Wabbajack file from the Files tab on Nexus and click the Install From Drive button in Wabbajack. Locate the Wabbajack file and click open. Choose the install location inside of the Modlists folder you created above earlier. You can specify the download location for the wabbajack mods to install to another location if you choose. Once finished, hit the button to the right and it will begin downloading everything needed.

# Hardware Specifications

Fallout 4 will occasionally take up a lot of GPU and CPU so anything that's at least these recommended specs or above should compute.
