    "description": "Fable Lore is a unique modlist that takes on the deleveling aspect of Skyrim modding to a whole new experience, where instead of relying on an already existing mod, such as Requiem, and building the list around it, the deleveled experience is built around the list. Utilizing Synthesis, the modlist comes with a completely custom add-on built specifically for the list that delevels the entire world, as well as hundreds of thousands of tweaks and balancing to account for every single mod in the list.",
