# VALHÖLL

VALHÖLL is a extensively modded version of Valheim, introducing new systems and mechanics that expand upon the base game giving more functionality and content to explore. Featuring some of the most popular mods such as Epic Loot, Valheim Plus, Project Auga, and more, Valheim has never felt so much better.

## Features

Some of the greatest feats this modlist achieves are:

- Fully compatible mods and indistinguishable modded experience to the base game
- Balanced in every aspect to make Valheim a still challenging and fun experience
- New systems expanding on the already existing systems in-game
- And much more!

## Installation

The process of installation is fairly simple, similar to any other modlist downloadable on Wabbajack.

Locate and find VALHÖLL in the Valheim game section of Wabbajack and download the modlist. Hit the play button, then choose an installation locate for the modlist, ensure it is on the same drive that Valheim is installed, and hit the play button again.

After it has finished installing, click **Install Folder** and launch **ModOrganizer.exe**. You can create a shortcut, pin it to the Start menu or taskbar and launch it that way from now on. In Mod Organizer 2, simply hit Run in the top right of the program and Valheim will launch.
