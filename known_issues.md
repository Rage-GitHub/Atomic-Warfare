### In-Progress
- Unable to launch from Fallout 4 Script Extender executable, providing an error that points to Root Builder.
  - Ocassionally caused by the Modlist not being installed on the same drive as Fallotu 4.
- Micro stuttering when wandering around randomly, causing huge influxes in the FPS.

### Planned
- Screen flashbanging on initial save startup, I.E. your screen will gradually grow brighter and audio bugs out (Can be fixed by reloading the save)
  - Temporary solution is to pause the game, save, exit to main menu then reload that save.

### Looking At
- 

### Fixed
- Implementing in 1.2.0
  - Missing/Broken textures in Concord Museum resulting in combining or completely gone textures
